## Digital art and artists today

Today's creators imagine, draw, paint with electronic brushes but strangely the purpose of their work is mainly monetized on paper, or even cotton etc. A little counter-intuitive for digital image painters. But then where is our version of the paper web 2.0?

Today, we no longer have the same relationship with art, our inspirations come from Behance, Dribbble and content aggregators like Muzli or Pinterest. Fortunately sometimes we dive back in time, and discover painters, artists who have marked history with their talents.

Certain rules allow us to build and bring a general harmony to our creations. But just look where we get our inspiration from today! I have a logo to make? Dribble. I have a poster to do let's look at Pinterest. Exposed to everyone's eyes, inspiration is everywhere in open-air galleries accessible to everyone. Art evolves with the tools at our disposal. Allowing us to create 3D objects, to animate drawings... and all the other techniques discovered by the creation of software such as Photoshop, illustrator or Procreate.

We consume art differently, to such an extent that it is perhaps interesting to discover the evolutions that this can bring about for artists but also for consumers/fans of art today.

## A generation z, a strong digital footprint

Our Generation, that of cartoons like Naruto and beyblade spinning tops that we call Generation Z (born from 1997). They were born in digital and have known the world only with technologies. The most popular artists are no longer exhibited in a museum but on a page.

Their values ​​and talents are calculable in likes, comments and shares of a community. Generation Z is a generation that has a very strong digital footprint. Let's take a simple example, what are the most valuable objects in the eyes of this Generation in your opinion? His telephone ? Her photos ? His skins on are favorite games? Chances are you answered something non-physical. Or an object that allows you to observe a dematerialized asset.

These digital assets are becoming more and more important, they sometimes have a strong emotional value, it's a kind of digital collection, in which you can find photos, memes or Fornite/CSGO skins.

## An answer to the problem of artists?

We all know talented creators who remain in the shadow of the greats.

Some people, we sometimes discover them in the detours of an Instagram page highlighting them, sometimes when researching on Pinterest to find inspiration. All these creators have one thing in common: a small notoriety, but perhaps not enough to create T-shirts, stickers, posters to start getting paid for their work.

When for others, notoriety has allowed them to develop their business, they quickly find themselves with copies of their work on sometimes dubious platforms and can do nothing against copycats.

NFTs can be used for these 2 problems with the possibility of verifying the works of artists, like an electronic signature. For simplicity, all digital objects have a unique identification available and verifiable by everyone. NFTs are smart contracts, so they also help secure a greater share of revenue by creating a more egalitarian system. They also make it easier to create communities with its "collectible" aspect, as Pokémon cards were in playgrounds at the time.

Let's take an example to be clearer: Let's imagine that I create an NFT! A wonderful motion design. My friends decide to buy the NFT (therefore my motion design) for the collection and support me in my project. Now overnight I become known, my friends who originally bought my work can keep it to continue supporting me, or resell it. Their support provided at the beginning, and rewarded according to the notoriety that I will be able to have. So I have every interest in promoting my artist not only because I appreciate their work but also because I would most likely be rewarded in the long run by keeping the asset. At the same time creating a virtuous circle allowing the highlighting of artists.

To explain to you in more detail how NTFs work, I must explain a few things to you beforehand which will allow you to imagine the possibilities that go beyond art since art is only one possibility of use among so many others.

## What are NFTs?

NFTs are considered to be a cryptocurrency, everyone knows Bitcoin but there are many other projects using blockchain. Non-fungible tokens are one such promising project. NFTs is the acronym for Non-Fungible Token (finally Non-Fungible Token in English). To fully understand how NFTs work, we need to go back to the difference between fungible assets and non-fungible assets. A fungible asset is not unique, it is interchangeable and cannot be differentiated from one another.

Let's take the example of banknotes, you can exchange a €20 note with another €20 note, they will have the same value. We can also divide this banknote into several times, each change that you will make such as purchases or exchanges cannot be noted somewhere to know the history of the life of your 20€ banknote.

<br />
Another example, bitcoin is only partially fungible since it is divisible into smaller
pieces (which we call satoshi by the way) but it has an identification of transactions
visible to everyone. Yes it is possible to trace bitcoin exchanges. Conversely, if
we take a non-fungible asset, it has a unique identification noted in a "smart contract"
making it possible to trace all the movements of the asset. They are neither exchangeable
nor divisible between them since they do not represent the same thing. It can be
a work of an artist, a football player, a historical moment etc... We can take a
simple example: cars. Take a Golf, it all has a unique number. But each car has its
own characteristics such as the color, or the rims. This makes them unique and non-exchangeable
since technically it does not represent the same thing. Yet they are all golf courses.

We can summarize these few lines to better understand: We therefore have a non-fungible asset called NFT, with a unique and traceable identifier and containing a digital, exchangeable and collectable asset.

Digital assets can represent many things. But let's take the example of artists again! They can create a unique work that will be collectable and traceable. On the consumer side, they will be able to buy a work by their favorite artists with the possibility of exchanging it, reselling it or even keeping it for later.

Let's take examples of the use of NFT's! You may have heard of "Crypto Kitties" which was one of the first NFTs. The principle was quite simple: a collection of cards with different cat designs. Each piece was unique and had a certain value and rarity. It was a real hit, many people wanted to collect them all and especially to have the rarest ones just to be the only one to have them. With a record sale of over $110,000 for the rarest cat.

Other projects followed, I am giving you a small non-exhaustive list which is changing very quickly but it shows the possibilities offered by NFTs. There is no doubt that it will end up exploding in the next few years.

Il existe beaucoup d'autres artistes, et de plus en plus d'entre eux commencent à s'intéresser à cette manière de monétiser leur travail.

Enjoy your day
